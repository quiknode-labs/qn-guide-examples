## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js 20.x or later
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- A QuickNode endpoint URL with Base DeFi Bundle access
- A WalletConnect Project ID (for wallet connections)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quiknode-labs/qn-guide-examples.git
cd qn-guide-examples/sample-dapps/base-dex-aggregator
```

2. Install dependencies:


```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID"
VITE_QUICKNODE_ENDPOINT_URL="YOUR_QUICKNODE_ENDPOINT_URL"
```

You can get a WalletConnect Project ID by signing up at [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com).

## Running Locally

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

# Deploy
vercel
```

## API Integrations

This application integrates with the following QuickNode [Base DeFi Power Bundle](https://marketplace.quicknode.com/bundles/basebundle) APIs:

1. **Gas Estimation API** (`sentio_gasPrice`): Provides real-time gas estimates for Base.
2. **OpenOcean v4 Swap API**: Used for token lists, swap quotes, and swap transactions.
3. **Base Blockbook JSON-RPC** (`bb_getAddress`): Fetches wallet balance, token holdings, and transaction history.

## Application Logic and Base Bundle Integration

This application demonstrates how to build a full-featured DeFi application using QuickNode's Base Bundle add-ons. Here's how each component of the Base Bundle is utilized:

### Gas Estimation with Sentio Gas API

The application uses the `sentio_gasPrice` RPC method to fetch real-time gas estimates for the Base network:

1. The `useGasEstimate` hook in `src/hooks/useGasEstimate.tsx` provides gas price data
2. Gas prices are used in swap calculations to provide accurate cost estimates
3. The implementation uses the JSON-RPC interface via axios in `src/lib/api.ts`

```typescript
// Example: Fetching gas estimates
export async function fetchGasEstimates() {
  const response = await axios.post(
    QUICKNODE_ENDPOINT_URL,
    {
      id: 1,
      jsonrpc: "2.0",
      method: "sentio_gasPrice",
      params: { chainId: BASE_CHAIN_ID },
    }
  );
  return response.data.blockPrices[0].estimatedPrices;
}
```

### Token Swaps with OpenOcean v4 API

The application integrates OpenOcean's v4 API through QuickNode's Base Bundle:

1. Token list retrieval for displaying available tokens
2. Swap quote generation with price impact and routing information
3. Swap execution
4. All OpenOcean endpoints are accessed via the QuickNode endpoint URL

```typescript
// Example: OpenOcean API URL construction
const OPENOCEAN_API_URL = `${QUICKNODE_ENDPOINT_URL}addon/807/v4/base`;
```

### Wallet History with Base Blockbook

The wallet history feature uses the Blockbook JSON-RPC interface:

1. The `useWalletHistory` hook fetches transaction history and token balances
2. The `bb_getAddress` method provides comprehensive wallet information
3. The wallet panel displays transaction history with timestamps and status

```typescript
// Example: Fetching wallet history
export async function fetchWalletHistory(address: string) {
  const response = await axios.post(
    QUICKNODE_ENDPOINT_URL,
    {
      id: 1,
      jsonrpc: "2.0",
      method: "bb_getAddress",
      params: [address, { page: 1, size: 20, details: "txids" }],
    }
  );
  return response.data;
}
```

This architecture demonstrates how QuickNode's Base Bundle provides a complete toolkit for building secure, high-performance DeFi applications without managing complex infrastructure.
