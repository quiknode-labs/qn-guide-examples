## Quick Tac Toe

This is the final example of the [QuickNode Solana Basics Course](http://localhost:3000/courses/solana/solana-basics/overview). In this example, we build a simple tic-tac-toe game on the Solana blockchain. The game is played between two players, and the game state is stored on the Solana blockchain.
